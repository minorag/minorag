# minorag
Minorag is a lightweight, offline-friendly RAG CLI for developers. It indexes your codebase across multiple repositories, computes embeddings locally (Ollama or any provider), and enables natural-language search and Q&amp;A over your source code. No cloud, no telemetry, fully local, fully yours.
